## Unity Micro FPS Test

Also hosted [on SIMMER.io](https://simmer.io/@w_alexander/micro-fps-test). This is the Micro FPS taken from the Unity Interactive Tutorials. "Logging" has been set to "Full" and "Enable Exceptions" has been set to "Full With  Stacktrace" to stop getting the "memory access out of bounds" error (this is not a Development Build).
